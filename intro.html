<h2>Introduction to GPU computing for statisticians</h2>

Day: Monday, September 16<br/>
Time: 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM<br/>
Place: <a href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/buildings/building.asp?id=119">Snedecor Hall 2113</a><br/><br/>

GPUs, or Graphics processing units, were mostly used as gaming toys at their inception. 
But now, scientists and statisticians use GPUs to speed up their data 
analysis software by orders of magnitude. Become a part of this revolution 
in massively parallel computing and come learn how to speed up a variety of 
parallelizable computations, from Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to K-means 
clustering and beyond. This talk, which 
 begins the fall semester weekly seminar series on GPU computing, will 
 introduce the Iowa State Statistics Department's GPU clusters and 
 the paradigm of general purpose GPU computing.
