<h2>CUDA C: K-means and MCMC</h2>

Day: Monday, October 7<br/>
Time: 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM<br/>
Place: <a href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/buildings/building.asp?id=119">Snedecor Hall 2113</a><br/><br/>

At this point in the series, we're ready to parallelize some simple but interesting 
statistical algorithms. The first example in this talk is classic Lloyd's K-means in 
two dimensions, and the second is a Markov chain Monte Carlo from an example from 
Dr. Jarad Niemi's STAT 544 class from the spring semester of 2013. The MCMC will 
also be a preview of topics to come in future lectures, such as shared memory, the 
CURAND library, and the Thrust library. More importantly, both examples will showcase 
some best practices in CUDA C programming, including error checking with Valgrind and 
CUDA MEMCHECK.
