<h2>A codeless introduction to GPU parallelism</h2>

Day: Monday, September 23<br/>
Time: 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM<br/>
Place: <a href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/buildings/building.asp?id=119">Snedecor Hall 2113</a><br/><br/>

This talk will explain GPU parallelism without the use of computer code. 
After reviewing the paradigm in general, I will explain how to parallelize
some example algorithms, including pairwise summation, matrix multiplication,
the classic K-means clustering algorithm, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo. The ideas 
presented will lay the conceptual foundation for the next three talks, 
which discuss how to implement GPU parallelism with CUDA C.
